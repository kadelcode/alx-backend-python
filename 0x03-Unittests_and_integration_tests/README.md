# Unittest and integration tests

## Tasks
### 0. Parameterize a unit test
Familiarize yourself with the ```utils.access_nested_map``` function and understand its purpose. Play with it in the Python console to make sure you understand.

In this task you will write the first unit test for ```utils.access_nested_map```.

Create a ```TestAccessNestedMap``` class that inherits from ```unittest.TestCase```.

Implement the ```TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map``` method to test that the method returns what it is supposed to.

Decorate the method with ```@parameterized.expand``` to test the function for following inputs:
```
nested_map={"a": 1}, path=("a",)
nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a",)
nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a", "b")
```
For each of these inputs, test with assertEqual that the function returns the expected result.

The body of the test method should not be longer than 2 lines.

### 1. Parameterize a unit test
Implement ```TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map_exception```. Use the ```assertRaises``` context manager to test that a ```KeyError``` is raised for the following inputs (use ```@parameterized.expand```):
```
nested_map={}, path=("a",)
nested_map={"a": 1}, path=("a", "b")
```
Also make sure that the exception message is as expected.

### 2. Mock HTTP calls
Familiarize yourself with the ```utils.get_json``` function.

Define the ```TestGetJson(unittest.TestCase)``` class and implement the ```TestGetJson.test_get_json``` method to test that ```utils.get_json``` returns the expected result.

We donâ€™t want to make any actual external HTTP calls. Use ```unittest.mock.patc```h to patch ```requests.get```. Make sure it returns a ```Mock``` object with a ```json``` method that returns ```test_payload``` which you parametrize alongside the ```test_url``` that you will pass to ```get_json``` with the following inputs:
```
test_url="http://example.com", test_payload={"payload": True}
test_url="http://holberton.io", test_payload={"payload": False}
```
Test that the mocked ```get method``` was called exactly once (per input) with ```test_url``` as argument.

Test that the output of ```get_json``` is equal to ```test_payload```.

### 3. Parameterize and patch
Read about memoization and familiarize yourself with the utils.memoize decorator.

Implement the TestMemoize(unittest.TestCase) class with a test_memoize method.

Inside test_memoize, define following class
```
class TestClass:

    def a_method(self):
        return 42

    @memoize
    def a_property(self):
        return self.a_method()
```
Use unittest.mock.patch to mock a_method. Test that when calling a_property twice, the correct result is returned but a_method is only called once using assert_called_once.

### 4. Parameterize and patch as decorators
Familiarize yourself with the ```client.GithubOrgClient``` class.

In a new ```test_client.py``` file, declare the ```TestGithubOrgClient(unittest.TestCase)``` class and implement the ```test_org``` method.

This method should test that ```GithubOrgClient.org``` returns the correct value.

Use ```@patch``` as a decorator to make sure ```get_json``` is called once with the expected argument but make sure it is not executed.

Use ```@parameterized.expand``` as a decorator to parametrize the test with a couple of ```org``` examples to pass to GithubOrgClient, in this order:

- google
- abc
Of course, no external HTTP calls should be made.

### 5. Mocking a property
```memoize``` turns methods into properties. Read up on how to mock a property (see resource).

Implement the ```test_public_repos_url``` method to unit-test ```GithubOrgClient._public_repos_url```.

Use ```patch``` as a context manager to patch ```GithubOrgClient.org``` and make it return a known payload.

Test that the result of ```_public_repos_url``` is the expected one based on the mocked payload.
